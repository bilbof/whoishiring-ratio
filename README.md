# HN who wants to be hired ratio

Each month since 2014 [whoishiring] on Hacker News has posted a couple of posts: "Who is hiring?" and "Who wants to be hired?", and for the most part each descendant comment is a job opening or a job seeker on the posts respectively.

This script outputs how many job seekers there are vs how many jobs.
